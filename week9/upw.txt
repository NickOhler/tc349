I think that the concept for the United Pixel Workers is pretty cool. There aren’t enough ways for people who code to show that they love what they do and that they’re proud of it. UPX has a wide variety of shirts for a lot of different localities. I really like the design of their homepage. They don’t waste any time directing users around the site unnecessarily. A lot of the shirts that they sell are featured right on the first page. I can appreciate a design that values the user experience over traditional page structure. The grid-style layout of the homepage is very intuitive. The small rollover animations that they have embedded in the different grid elements give the site a very responsive feel. Their design concept manages being minimalistic, yet very functional at the same time. Their individual product pages are also very well designed. They have a minimal amount of steps required to pick the size and color you need, so you can get items into the cart quickly. A lot of ecommerce style sties make the buying process far too difficult, which isn’t good for conversions.
