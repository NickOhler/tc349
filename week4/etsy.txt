I have heard of Etsy before, but have never really looked into the site. After browsing around for a little while, I can say that I really like the concept. The selection is endless and itâ€™s really cool that everything (I think) is homemade. This would be a great place to get things that are really unique and you can probably know for sure that you wont see someone else with the same thing that you bought. They have chosen a grid-type layout for the site, and it suits them well. The layout is fairly easy to navigate and very functional. One suggestion that I would have for them is to provide a little bit more information about the uniqueness of their site. Upon first glance of the site, it seems to be a normal e-commerce type website. I think that they could make it a point to emphasize the uniqueness of their business model to first time visitors who might not know anything about them.
