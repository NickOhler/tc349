Happy Cog is winning right off the bat in my eyes, with their navigation menu that stays fixed to the top of the page while you scroll. That’s an easy way to improve usability that more sites should be taking advantage of. Another thing that I like about the homepage is the ‘borderless’ feel it has. The content is centered on the page without the use of unnecessary lines. A unique element of the Happy Cog site is how everything is on one page. The top navigation simply directs you to that section. I think that this makes site navigation a lot more intuitive. The next part of the site that I have to give props to is their featured work section. These pages have a great mix of dynamic imagery, information, and customer testimonials. I think that there are a lot of websites that could take a page out of Happy Cog’s book.
