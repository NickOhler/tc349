I have heard of Vimeo many times before, as well as watched quite a few of their videos that were embedded on other websites. However, this is the first time that I have actually visited their homepage. The first impression that I got it that it’s much more personable than YouTube is. The homepage of Vimeo is much more streamlined and simplified compared to YouTube. It seems as though YouTube wants you to leave the homepage and start watching videos as quickly as possible, while Vimeo wants you to stick around to find out what makes them different. Their friendly design makes me okay with that. From a usability standpoint, I’m impressed. I really appreciate sites that make it incredibly easy to see where to register/signup. Vimeo also does a better job of helping you find videos that you may be interested in. I found that their category-based navigational system is more effective than what YouTube uses. Another aesthetic element about the homepage that I enjoyed was the background images that stretched to the sides of the viewport. Images that reach both ends of the viewport seem to make for a more immersive web experience.
