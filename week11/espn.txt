The first website that comes to mind when I think of mobile is ESPN.com. I can truly appreciate the mobile version of this site because viewing the full-sized version on a cellphone wouldn’t be a delightful experience. The site features a navigation bar that is clear and concise, while still including most of the content from the original version of the website. They have managed to put a lot of content onto the first page, but in a way that is easily digested by the user.The first page of ESPN’s mobile site includes the main story, a scrolling bar of current game scores, a listing of the current top stories, videos, and this continues on with secondary level content. Digging deeper into the actual stories themselves, it’s easy to see that ESPN also spent some time optimizing the site here as well. Stories are very legible, often including video for a more immersive experience. Overall, I think ESPN did a good job of capturing the essence of their full site in the mobile optimized version. It’s easy to find the information that you’re looking for, with having to zoom way in and search all over the page.
