	<h3>My Critique of panic.com</h3>
	<p>My initial impression of panic.com is very good. The homepage offers a design that is very functional, smooth, and minimalistic. The animation on the main icons is also very slick. I appreciate that they choose to use fonts against contrasting backgrounds, making it very easy to read even the smaller text on their site. </p>
	<p>The strong point of panic.com is it’s extremely intuitive user interface. As your eyes scan the page, they are guided to the next point of interest, without any confusion on where to go next. The critical information on the site is displayed in an easily digestible fashion. Their product tours made it quite easy to understand what each piece of software is intended to do. </p>
