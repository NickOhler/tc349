Heroku’s homepage is a streamlined, hybrid type layout. Their layout almost resembles a gallery type. It allows you to select different product functionalities, which brings up more information specific to that part of the product. I enjoy their darker color scheme; it’s easy on the eyes and still easy to quickly scan for information. The concept of Heroku is very attractive. It looks as though it would be useful for almost any company where employees need to work cooperatively with the same programs, which are most modern businesses. This could be a very useful tool for project managers, as they can see an overview of the status from any application being used.
