Michigan State has a very good homepage, in comparison to a lot of other educational institutions. I prefer the way their page is designed, where the content is tight and centered on the page. It is broken up into different modules, which make it easy to scan the page for relevant information. The navigation interface is also something to be admired. The top navigation bar is easy to use and very intuitive, making it easy to get to where you need to go. Beyond the function of the page, there are many modern, stylish elements to the page. At the center of attention, there is a rotating flash banner, which is visually pleasing. The banner does a great job of advertising whatâ€™s currently going on at the university. There is also a small section on the homepage that displays some recent tweets that are relevant to the school. Displaying tweets on the homepage is an interesting and modern element. Overall, the page is functional and aesthetically pleasing.
