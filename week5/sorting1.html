	<h2>Process and Findings</h2>
	<p>The architecture of the site was relatively close to what was defined by my sort, as well as the sort determined by the participants. I found that my sort happened pretty quickly, while my participants took their time to finally decide on the groups that they wanted to stick with.</p>
	<p>My sort did differ slightly from the sort that my participants made. The participants left a couple pieces of content alone, to be a group of their own. This resulted in my sort have one less category. The participants had one large 'buying' group, which included everything product related. My sort included both a 'promotional' and 'product buying' categories</p>
