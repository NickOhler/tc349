	<h2>Analysis and findings</h2>
	<p>My own sorting, as well as the group sorting revealed an architecture that is similar to what is current implemented on my personal site. The part that was the most ambiguous from the sort was the home page. The next step in the planning of my personal website will be to decide on which content the homepage will hold.</p>
