At first glance, I love the dynamic elements to charbeats's homepage. The changing graphic is a really unique element. The site is very streamlined and the content is easy to find. I like the site copy, as it is concise and a little cheeky even. 

The constantly changing elements on the homepage are really engaging. They're something that I haven't seen before. I imagine that they could be very useful in a lot of modern web design applications. Some of the sub-pages feature images with an overlaying magnifying glass, to enhance viewing. I thought this was another cool element to the site.
